# Animate bubble maps

In this repo, I'll guide you through the step-by-step process of visualizing the devastating impact of the Syrian civil war using the [UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset (UCDP GED)](https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/index.html#ged_global) data on civilian fatalities. Using R's powerful data visualization libraries, ggplot2 and gganimate, we'll bring the data to life by creating an engaging and informative animated bubble map.
